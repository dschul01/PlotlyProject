# PlotlyProject

Utilize Plotly.js, HTML, and JavaScript to create an interactive data visualization on results of a bacteria study. 

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a dashboard which contains Plotly.js built interactive charts showing the results of an extensive study on bacterial data.  The dashboard contains three charts created upon a user selecting a test subject within a drop down box.   

1) The bar chart displays the Top 10 bacteria cultures found within the selected test subject's belly button.
2) The gauge displays the selected test subject's weekly washing frequency of their belly button.
3) A bubble chart displays all cultures found within the selected test subject's belly button with marker sizes based on culture size

## Additional Customizations
HTML was utilized to add more design to the webpage.  An image was added to the jumbotron with a font color which would show through the image.  A fairly opaque green background was added to the body to give the site a little more life.  Additionally, descriptions were added to the charts so the user knows what they are seeing.
